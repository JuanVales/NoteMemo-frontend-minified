Back-end Technology:
The back end of NoteMemo is powered by Node.js and Express, with Express sessions for managing user sessions. User authentication is handled using 
Passport.js, with strategies for Google OAuth2.0 and Passport Local for local username/password authentication. MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud-based 
database solution, and Mongoose is employed as the ODM tool for interacting with the MongoDB database.

local account. Once logged in, you can manage your notes by adding, editing, and deleting them. Your notes will be automatically saved and synchronized across devices.
